# Stickytimer is a WIP

## Todo:
- Make it so user can *set* the time
- Add buttons for reset
  - Maybe stop -> this will lead us back to whatever time setting interface
- Currently it *WILL NOT* overlay the taskbar in windows
  - Is it possible to? Is it worth it?
  - If it ends up being intrusive or something, I can make it opt-in or include instructions I guess..
- Make the timer re-sizable, including scaling the elements
- Play a sound when timer ends
- Properties menu
  - Behaviour on end
    - Sound on/off, maybe volume?
  - Transperency control
  - Colour scheme
- 


## Nice-to-have
- Hidden handlebar 
  - Fade in effect when hovered over
  - Larger clickable area around the outside of the button
 
- Pomodoro cycle?
  - Enable alternating between like a 15 -> 5 min timer
  - Autostart 2nd part
